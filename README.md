In this video, we are going to build advanced semantic search from scratch by using new updated elastic search and the new json mode of chat GPT. If a user searches for: Blue T shirts for men under 2k. Normal semantic search results might give results which contain other color T-shirts as well. It can contain T-shirts for women as well and it will most probably not understand that we want T-shirts only under the price of 2000. We will see how we can fine-tune these results so that the user will get most accurate products according to his/her query
